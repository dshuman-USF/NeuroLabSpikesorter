	* spikesort_control_panel.in: The command in get_bounds "cat bounds. . . "
	recently started embedding control codes in the output. The terminal, the
	shell, don't know. This broke picking up the numbers, so the codes are now
	filtered out of the text returned to expect.
	* configure.ac: Bump to 1.18.3

2020-10-26  dshuman@usf.edu

	* mpk_regions.c: remove commented out lines spikedata and spike_waveform
	because they only need to be defined in one place, and they are in nde.h,
	which causes multiple defines. I don't see how this ever worked unless
	earlier versions of the compiler allowed this.
	* nde.h: Add extern in from of spikedata and spike_waveform. See above.

	its time is earlier than the previously written pulse.  Fixes a
	spikesorter merge crash in edt_merge when the phrenic .chan file

	codes out of order.

	* edt_merge.c (min_time): Show a better error message when codes
	are out of order in an input file.

	/proc/PID/exe link value.  Fixes running channels coming up as "to
	do" in spikesort_control_panel when bash is updated during a

	* tkss.tcl.in (update_hist):
	* waveform.tcl:
	(set_dr_times, new_ymag, scroll, pick, mouse): tcl8.5 format the
	results of expr differently, so use explicit formats.  Fixes
	excessively long numbers in display.

	* configure.ac: bump rev to 0.11.9

	* tkss.c (get_color): replace Tcl_AppendElement with
	Tcl_SetResult.  In tcl8.5, Tcl_AppendElement puts braces around
	the color string, maing it unrecognizable to -configure.  Fixes
	crash in tkss.tcl.

2014-04-22  Russell O'Connor  <roconnor@health.usf.edu>

	* info_file.pl:
	(getvals): use consecutive integers starting with 1 for the
	reference electrode pseudo-cell merged channel numbers (mchan),
	rather than their dchan value, and limit the number of reference
	electrodes to 50 so as not to overlap with the merged channel
	number range for normal cells.  Removes the restriction that

	coordinate spreadsheet.  Allows info_file.pl to be used on Cygnus
	and DAQ experiments.

	statements.

2014-03-20  Russell O'Connor  <roconnor@health.usf.edu>

	can share home directories

2009-04-27  Russell O'Connor  <roconnor@health.usf.edu>

	* spikesort_control_panel.in: wait for prompt after getting
	requester status string so the next command does not hang the
	connection.  Disable dispatch and stop dispatch button immediately
	when pressed, so the user will know it took.

	* Makefile.am (requester_SOURCES): 
	* old_requester.c:
	* requester.c: call old_requester if argc is 2 or 4, for backward
	compatibilitya
	
	* requester.c:
	* spikesort_control_panel.in: 
	add cpu number to requests directory, nohup file, and job number
	file so that multiple spikesorts can run on one host.

	* configure.ac: bump rev to 0.9.30

	* region.c: delete unused component_val routine

2009-01-06  Russell O'Connor  <roconnor@health.usf.edu>

	* spikesort_control_panel.in: change gv argument from "-scale +2"
	to "-scale=2" to fix DIAGRAM feature that broke due to changes in
	gv

2008-08-06  Russell O'Connor  <roconnor@health.usf.edu>

	* muph.c (main): give error message on remove or rename failure

2008-02-06  Russell O'Connor  <roconnor@health.usf.edu>

	* configure.ac: bump rev to 0.9.29

	* region.c: stdlib.h instead of malloc.h on Apple systems
	(malloc_usable_size): define to return 1 on Apple systems
	(decompose_unclassified_regions): take out mallinfo calls on
	Apple systems

	* dmx.h (fopen64, etc): remove the "64" on Apple systems

	* Makefile.am: compile requester only on linux, add getline.c to
	nfs_lock sources if not on linux

	* configure.ac: add AM_CONDITIONAL for LINUX

2008-01-22  Russell O'Connor  <roconnor@health.usf.edu>

	* configure.ac: bump rev to 0.9.28

	* waveform.tcl: set the initial width on the first configure,
	rather than the first expose and 6ms after startup.  Fixes
	intermittent bad size.
	Use 'h' toggle instead of shift for stretching waveform.  Make
	background blue in stretch mode.  The shift-resize seems to have
	been co-opted by the window manager for maximizing.

2008-01-18  Russell O'Connor  <roconnor@health.usf.edu>

	* configure.ac: bump rev to 0.9.27

	* waveform.c (SquareCmd): 
	* tkss.c (SquareCmd): initialize squarePtr time, data, type, and
	yscale.  Fixes tkss.tcl crashing with a segfault on cisc2.

2008-01-17  Russell O'Connor  <roconnor@health.usf.edu>

	* configure.ac: bump rev to 0.9.26

	* tkss.tcl.in:  isolate -data option for special handling

	* configure.ac: bump rev to 0.9.25

	* tkss.tcl: isolate -data option for special handling

	* configure.ac: bump rev to 0.9.24

	* tkss.c (SquareConfigure): handle "-data" option specially
	so it works on 64-bit systems.

2008-01-03  Russell O'Connor  <roconnor@health.usf.edu>

	* configure.ac: bump rev to 0.9.23

	* waveform.c (SquareConfigure): handle "-data" option specially
	so it works on 64-bit systems.  Fixes waveform.tcl crashing with a
	segfault on cisc1 and cisc2.

2008-01-02  Russell O'Connor  <roconnor@health.usf.edu>

	* configure.ac: bump rev to 0.9.22

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): add xls2csv.pl

	* requester.c (main): comment out unused rdtsc stuff and delete
	the include of <asm/msr.h> that was giving compile errors.

2007-08-17  Russell O'Connor  <roconnor@health.usf.edu>

	* waveform.tcl: set geometry after 6 ms instead of immediately.
	Fixes window coming up larger in height than requested.
	In set_dr_times, don't set xscale until the width is greater than
	200, instead of > 1.  Fixes right_time being slightly off.
	
2007-05-18  Russell O'Connor  <roconnor@health.usf.edu>

	* Makefile.am (bin_SCRIPTS): add xls2csv.pl

	* spikesort_control_panel.in: get_bounds: allow characters between
	the dollar sign and the space of the prompt.

2006-07-17  Russell O'Connor  <roconnor@(none)>

	* spikesort_control_panel.in: set test to 0 before conditionally
	setting it, so it will work in non-test mode.

2006-07-12  Russell O'Connor  <roconnor@(none)>

	* info_file.pl: write the info file in /oberon/experiments instead
	of /oberon/datamax

	* extensive changes to spikesort_control_panel for "nohup", plus
	requester and nfs_lock

.TH SPIKESORT_CONTROL_PANEL 1 "03 March 2005"
.SH NAME
spikesort_control_panel - Spike sorter control panel
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B spikesort_control_panel
.I filename
.SH INTRODUCTION
.B Spikesort_control_panel
is a graphical user interface (GUI) for the spikesorter.
.B Spikesort_control_panel
should only be run as a non root user.  When
.B spikesort_control_panel
is run at USF on the blades, it should be
run as user "ssu".

At the command prompt, type
.B
spikesort_control_panel
followed by the path to the DataMax file [
.I filename
].

The DataMax file can be either the entire recording or just the header
(the .dmx file), and it must be in the same directory as the split-out
channel files.

The DataMax file name and the channel file names must be related in a
certain way.  First, they must share the same prefix. The DataMax file
name must consist of just the prefix, a dot, and a filetype
(= extension).  If the DataMax file name is of the form

.RS
prefix.typ
.RE

then the channel file names must be of the form

.RS
prefix_typ_NN.chan
.RE

where NN is the channel number.

The DataMax file with the entire recording in it normally has a name
whose filetype (extension) is a 3-digit recording number, and this is
what the
.B
spikesort_control_panel
expects to be pointed at.  But it is
likely that you will want to use just the header file, which normally
has a .dmx extension.  And it is normal that the channel files have
the recording number embedded in their names, so you need to point
.B
spikesort_control_panel
at a file with a recording number extension.
You can accomplish this by creating a symbolic link to the header
file, and giving the symbolic link the required name.

You can do this after changing to the directory with the .dmx file in
it, by typing, at the command prompt, a command of the form

.RS
.B
ln
-s prefix.dmx prefix.001
.RE

So with our current conventions, you would type, for example:
.RS
.B
spikesort_control_panel
/datamax/2004-12-01/clean/2004-12-01.001
.RE

.SH NOTES
The spikesort_control_panel needs to know about the labels that are
used on the channels.  The processing that it defaults to depends on
the first word of the channel label.  The label first words that it
knows about are:
.RS
Pegasus         Adj             Gemini          Medusa
.RE
.RS
N1              N2              N4              N5
.RE
.RS
Blood           CO2             Tracheal        Stimulus
.RE
.RS

If a new one is added, spikesort_control_panel needs to be modified to
know about it.
